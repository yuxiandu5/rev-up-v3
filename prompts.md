You are a senior engineer reviewing my pull request.

Your tasks:

1. Point out readability issues (naming, structure, comments).
2. Check maintainability (is this too brittle? duplicated logic?).
3. Check scalability (what breaks if the project grows?).
4. Highlight any anti-patterns or bad practices.
5. Suggest concrete improvements with examples.
6. Be bluntâ€”assume I can handle tough feedback.

I have attached the code.
